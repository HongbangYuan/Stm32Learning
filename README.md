# Stm32Learning
I take a stm32 course this semester and I intend to publish some code that might be useful later. <br>
Before getting started I must express my sincere thanks to [YiqunChen](https://github.com/YiqunChen1999).Without him,I would not think
about stepping on the way to CV,thought this might not be my final job and does nothing to do with this repository. <br>
I will give a brief description of this repository. 
# GPIO
Configure the registers directly to implement the running light(sounds really disgusting,right?).<br>
 
# The following code will reamain updating......
